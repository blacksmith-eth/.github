Blacksmith's mission is to radically improve the smart contract development process. That mission started with our namesake project [blacksmith](https://github.com/blacksmith-eth/blacksmith), which generates a simple frontend for interacting with smart contracts.

We are excited to continue to expand our offerings and improve the development experience for smart contract developers.

_A special thanks to contributors and maintainers of the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/) and [wagmi](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi) projects. Without your work Blacksmith would not be possible._
